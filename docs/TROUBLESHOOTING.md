# Troubleshooting & footguns (living checklist)

Pitfalls we've actually hit during **development, debugging, and release** — with
the check that would have caught each one early. This is a **living document**:
when a new footgun costs real time, add an entry here (symptom → root cause → the
must-check / rule), so the next person (or Claude) trips a checklist instead of the
rake. Keep entries short and action-first.

> Related runbooks live next to their subsystem: remote-access / pairing debug in

## Release / git-ops

### Never inline backtick-containing prose into a shell-substituted string
**Symptom:** `gh pr create` / `git commit` prints `foo: command not found`, the PR
body comes out mangled, and — worse — a random process (once a rogue `gtmux serve`)
is now running and squatting a port.
**Root cause:** backticks and `$(…)` inside a **double-quoted** string are command
substitution. Wrapping a heredoc as `--body "$(cat <<'EOF' … EOF)"` re-enables that
substitution around the heredoc, so any `` `word` `` in the markdown body (we fence
identifiers like `` `gtmux serve` `` constantly) gets **executed as a command**. A
`<<'EOF'` quoted delimiter protects the heredoc *body* but not the `"$(…)"` you wrap
it in.
**Rules:**
- Write PR/issue/commit bodies to a **file**, then `gh pr create --body-file <path>`
  / `git commit -F <path>`. Never `--body "$(…)"` or `-m "$(…)"` on text with backticks.
- After any PR-create that warned or errored, run
  `ps aux | grep -E 'gtmux serve|<cmds you backticked>'` and kill stray processes.

### A code change isn't shipped until the right delivery path runs
Four artifacts, **three** paths (git tag ≠ device build ≠ `wrangler deploy`). Editing
`relay-worker/` or `tunnel-worker/` and merging changes **nothing live** until you
redeploy the Worker. See the Deploy table in `CLAUDE.md` and
[[relay-redeploy-footgun]]. Quick check when push behaves oddly:
`cd relay-worker && npx wrangler deployments list` vs. `git log -1 -- relay-worker/`.

### Release tag gate
Tagging `vX.Y.Z` runs the **full `make check`** (not a weaker `go test`), then
goreleaser + the macOS app build. CI can't see the menu bar — smoke-test the app on
real macOS before trusting a tag.

### Menu-bar "click to update" loops — the app reinstalls its OWN version
**Symptom:** the popover shows `New version X — click to update`; clicking it "finishes"
(no error), the app relaunches, and the SAME banner reappears. The CLI + app both stay
on the old version. `~/…/T/gtmux-update.log` shows `Release v<OLD>` / `Installed gtmux
v<OLD>` even though Go logged `Updating <OLD> → <NEW>`. Running `gtmux update` **by hand
in a normal shell works** (installs `<NEW>`).
**Root cause:** `install.sh`'s `open -n "…/Gtmux.app"` used to launch the app with the
installer's env still set, **leaking `GTMUX_VERSION=<OLD>` into the long-lived app
process**. The in-menu update runs `gtmux update`, which inherits that pin; Go honors a
pre-set `GTMUX_VERSION` (`if !LookupEnv(...)`) instead of resolving the latest, so
install.sh reinstalls `<OLD>` — forever. A manual shell has no `GTMUX_VERSION`, so it
resolves `<NEW>` and works. (After a re-login the login LaunchAgent starts the app with
a clean env, which is why a reboot "fixes" it.)
**Fix:** `install.sh` now strips it (`env -u GTMUX_VERSION open -n …`) so the app never
inherits the pin, and `Updater.spawnDetachedUpdate` runs `env -u GTMUX_VERSION gtmux
update` as a belt. **Diagnose** with `ps eww <GtmuxBar-pid> | tr ' ' '\n' | grep GTMUX_`
— a `GTMUX_VERSION=` there is the smell. **Unstick a machine now:** `gtmux update` from
a plain terminal, or just click update twice (the first click relaunches with a clean
env via the fixed install.sh).

## Remote access / pairing / push

### "Pairing code expired" that never clears — check for a DUPLICATE serve on :8765
**Symptom:** menubar "refresh code" → phone scans → *invalid or expired enroll code*,
no matter how fresh the code, across app reinstalls and `gtmux update`.
**Root cause:** two `gtmux serve` processes on 8765. The menubar mints via
`POST 127.0.0.1:8765` (IPv4 → serve A); the tunnel ingress `http://localhost:8765`
resolves to `::1` (IPv6 → serve B). **Enroll codes are in-memory per process**, so a
code minted on A is absent on B → "expired". (The same split corrupts push-token state.)
**Must-check (run this FIRST when pairing/push misbehaves):**
```
lsof -nP -iTCP:8765 -sTCP:LISTEN     # MUST show exactly one PID
ps aux | grep 'gtmux serve' | grep -v grep
```
Expect ONE serve — the app's `com.gtmux.serve` LaunchAgent
(`/…/Gtmux.app/Contents/MacOS/gtmux serve --bind 127.0.0.1 --port 8765`). Any second
`gtmux serve` (especially bare, binding `*:8765`) is a squatter → kill it. With only
`127.0.0.1` listening, cloudflared's `localhost` falls back to IPv4 and hits the same
serve the menubar mints on.

### Don't restart `gtmux serve` between mint and scan
Enroll codes (TTL 5 min) live only in memory; a serve restart (incl.
`launchctl kickstart`, and the `launchctl unload/load` that `gtmux tunnel --service`
does) wipes every pending code → a just-minted QR reads as "expired". Mint → scan
without bouncing serve in between.

### Tunnel silently offline on a corp network — QUIC is blocked
**Symptom:** phone gets Cloudflare **1033 / HTTP 530**; `tunnel.log` loops
`failed to dial to edge with quic: timeout` / `no free edge addresses left to resolve to`.
**Root cause:** cloudflared defaults to QUIC (UDP/7844); many corp/campus nets block it.
**Fix:** `--protocol http2` (TCP/443) — now the gtmux default for all cloudflared
launch paths (override with `GTMUX_TUNNEL_PROTOCOL`). An **old** service plist keeps
QUIC, so after `gtmux update` re-run `gtmux tunnel --service` to regenerate it.
Diagnose with `tail ~/.local/share/gtmux/tunnel.log`. See
`docs/design/remote-access-tunnel.md`.

### Corp-DNS hijack ≠ dead tunnel
The office net rewrites brand-new `ccy.dev` answers to internal `172.19.x` IPs, so the
Mac's own reachability probe fails on a *healthy* tunnel (returns HTTP 530). Verify the
last hop from a **phone on cellular**, not from the office LAN. `api.cloudflare.com` is
also intermittently TLS-reset here — retry `wrangler`.

### The app classifies enroll failures — read the phone's message
Since the enroll-error split, the phone names the failure class: *can't reach* /
*tunnel offline* / *code expired* / *no token*. Use that to jump straight to the right
section above instead of guessing.

## HQ attention system / perception feed

### `feed-degraded` in HQ — the perception feed is down
**Symptom:** HQ surfaces `⚠ perception feed down — on the 5-min polling backstop`, or a
`[CRITICAL gtmux:feed-degraded]` line appears in `gtmux hq-feed --tail`.
**Root cause:** the `gtmux hq-feed` daemon died and mechanical self-heal failed twice
(the no-LLM watchdog lives in the `gtmux serve` slow-tick — if serve is OFF, nothing
restarts it automatically).
**Must-check / fix:** `gtmux hq-feed --status` (running? heartbeat age ≤ 90s? cursor lag?).
If down, `gtmux hq-feed --daemon &` restarts it (singleton-guarded), or just re-attach
HQ's `gtmux hq-feed --tail` — the tail auto-starts the daemon. Confirm `gtmux serve` is
running so the watchdog can supervise it going forward. Files:
`~/.local/share/gtmux/hq-feed/{pid,cursor,heartbeat,spool.jsonl}`.

### HQ went quiet — is it the feed or the surfacing threshold?
**Symptom:** HQ stopped printing routine updates.
**Root cause:** by design. The feed is SILENT (gtmux no longer types low-value receipt
nudges into the pane); HQ only PRINTS CRITICAL/NORMAL and ledger-records QUIET. Quiet
mode raises the bar to CRITICAL-only.
**Must-check:** `gtmux quiet status` (the resolved threshold). QUIET items are in
`gtmux tasks --verbose`, not lost. A `feed-degraded` CRITICAL is never quieted, so
silence there means the feed is healthy, not broken.

### Seed is generated ONCE — a live HQ home won't auto-update
The attention-system behavior lives in the HQ playbook (`hq.go` `hqInstructions` →
`~/.config/gtmux/hq/AGENTS.md`), which is seeded once and never overwritten. A FRESH hq
home gets it automatically; the commander's EXISTING HQ needs a deliberate re-seed
(back up and remove/replace AGENTS.md, then `gtmux hq`) to pick up the feed/threshold/
self-check instructions.
