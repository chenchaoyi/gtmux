# CLI & commands

| command | what it does |
| --- | --- |
| `agents [--watch\|--json]` | coding agents across your panes: who's waiting / working / idle, where, and the pane id to jump to |
| `overview [--popup]` | sessions / windows / panes summary; `--popup` fits a tmux popup |
| `restore [--pick\|--one\|<name>\|--dry-run] [--resume-agents=auto\|type\|off]` | one terminal tab per session, attach all; optionally relaunch captured agent conversations |
| `focus <name\|pane-id\|--last>` | jump to a session's tab; a pane id (`%N`) lands on that exact pane; `--last` = the most-recently-finished agent |
| `new [name]` | start a new tmux session in a fresh terminal tab |
| `adopt <session_id>…` | move a sensed non-tmux (native) agent session into tmux |
| `doctor [--fix [--yes]]` | health check grouped by concern; `--fix` is the one-stop setup (hook, set-titles, restore, the app) |
| `install-hooks [--agent <key>]` | register the notification hook — Claude by default; `--agent codex\|cursor\|gemini\|copilot\|kiro` for others |
| `serve [--port N]` | read-only HTTP+SSE radar for the mobile app / browser mirror (behind a VPN or tunnel) |
| `tunnel [--backend cloudflare\|self] [--quick] [--service] [--redeem <code>]` | expose the radar from anywhere — Standard (Cloudflare) or Direct (paid); see [phone.md](phone.md) |
| `devices [revoke <id>]` | list / revoke phones paired via per-device tokens |
| `app` (alias `menubar`) | launch the menu-bar app (`Gtmux.app`) |
| `update [--check\|--cli-only]` | self-update the CLI + menu-bar app |

Bare `gtmux` prints help; `gtmux --version` prints the version. Output language
follows `--lang=en|zh` (default `en`) or `$GTMUX_LANG`. Everything is invoked
explicitly — no shell hooks, works with any shell.

## `gtmux agents`

```
gtmux agents — 6 agents · 1 waiting · 1 working · 4 idle

⏸ waiting  Claude Code  api:0.0     permission to run tests     %7
⠿ working  Claude Code  web:0.0     refactor auth middleware    %11
✳ idle     Claude Code  worker:0.0  add retry backoff     %8  ✓ latest
✳ idle     Codex        docs:0.0    —                     %1

jump: gtmux focus %7
```

Each row is **status · agent · location · task · pane id**, sorted by urgency.

- **⠿ working** — busy (don't bother it).
- **⏸ waiting** — blocked on **you** for a permission/approval, mid-task; sorts
  to the very top.
- **✳ idle** — finished its turn, your move when ready (not urgent).
- **⚠ errored** (amber) — an idle session that ended on an API/tool error (e.g.
  `Unable to connect to API`), not a clean finish. It's still idle (your move), just
  marked how it ended; the row shows the error summary. In `--json`: `error: true`
  + `error_text`.

`gtmux agents --watch` is a live, auto-refreshing dashboard (built with
[bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)): polls ~1.5s, **↑/↓**
select, **Enter** jumps to the pane, **r** refresh, **q** quit. `--json` emits
the same data for scripts and the menu-bar app.

### How detection works (not Claude-only)

- **Status** comes from the pane title the agent sets itself. A leading braille
  spinner (`⠋⠙⠹…`, what most agent TUIs animate) = **working**; Claude Code's `✳`
  = **idle**. This generalizes across agents that animate a spinner.
- **Which agent** is matched by foreground command (`claude`, `codex`, `gemini`,
  `aider`, `opencode`, …) or by a name in the title.
- Extend/override via `~/.config/gtmux/agents.json` — a JSON array of
  `{"name","commands","idleGlyph"}`; your entries win over the built-ins.
- A pane is listed only if the agent **process is actually running**. A leftover
  agent title over a plain shell (e.g. a resurrect-restored session never
  relaunched) is **not** counted.
- Agents running **outside tmux** (a bare `codex`/`claude` in a terminal) are
  **sensed** read-only via the same hook — listed under **Elsewhere** with
  `source:"native"`. They have no pane (no jump/reply); a resumable one can be
  pulled into tmux with `gtmux adopt <session_id>`.

`⏸ waiting` and `✓ latest` come from state files written by the
[notification hook](#notification-hook). Without it, agents never show `⏸`;
everything else still works.

## `gtmux digest` + `gtmux hq` — the supervisor (中控)

`gtmux digest` is the fleet at a glance, with MEANING instead of just status —
one block per agent:

```
● api:0.0 · Claude Code · waiting·permission  [api · main]
  goal: fix the login-token refresh bug
  last: Found it — the refresh path drops the exp claim. Patching now…
  asks: 1.Yes · 2.Yes, don't ask again · 3.No
```

Every field is assembled deterministically (zero LLM tokens) from what gtmux
already knows: **goal** = the session's last user prompt, **last** = the tail of
its last reply (both from the agent's own transcript), **asks** = a waiting
prompt's parsed options, plus the errored/background modifiers. `--json` emits
the machine form (also served as `GET /api/digest`). A session gtmux has no
transcript for still renders from radar signals alone — agents don't need to
cooperate.

`gtmux hq` opens (or focuses — never duplicates) the **supervisor**: your coding
agent running in a dedicated tmux session at `~/.config/gtmux/hq/`, seeded once
with instructions that teach it the loop — read `gtmux digest --json`, judge,
drill into a pane (`tmux capture-pane`) only when warranted, drive via
`gtmux send`, report to you. The playbook is seeded as `AGENTS.md` (the
cross-agent convention) with `CLAUDE.md` as an `@AGENTS.md` import — so the
supervisor can be ANY CLI agent: `gtmux hq --agent codex` (or `GTMUX_HQ_AGENT`).
Edit `AGENTS.md` to change its policy;
notes it keeps in that directory persist across its sessions. In the radar its
row carries `role:"supervisor"`.

When another agent starts **waiting** and an hq session is live, the hook types
one event line into it — `[gtmux] waiting·permission api:0.0 (%7) — <title>` —
so the supervisor learns of blockers without polling (same dedup as
notifications; never about itself; `"hqNudge": false` in
`~/.config/gtmux/config.json` disables). The nudge only informs: gtmux never
answers another agent's prompt, and the default policy tells the supervisor to
surface decisions to you, not take them.

## `gtmux usage` — token watch

```
● api:0.0        2.1M out · ctx 85% ·  7k/m   ⚠ ctx 85%
● web:0.0         830k out · ctx 60% · 391/m
Σ claude          2.9M out ·  7k/m · 2 sessions
```

Per-session token accounting parsed deterministically from the agent's own log
(zero LLM calls): cumulative output/input, the LIVE context footprint (the last
message's input + cache tokens, judged against an evidence-inferred window),
and a 10-minute spend rate. **Layered thresholds** per agent type in
`~/.config/gtmux/usage.json`:

```json
{"claude": {"ctxWarn": 0.8, "sessionOutWarn": 20000000,
            "typeRatePerMinWarn": 30000},
 "horizonMin": 30}
```

The evaluator also **projects** (`current + rate × horizon`) so you're warned
BEFORE a wall — `ctx→80% in ~9m` — not at it. Warnings surface as an amber
`usage_warn` on the radar row (`agents --json` / digest), in `gtmux usage`, and
as a one-per-layer `[gtmux] usage·warn …` nudge into a live HQ session. `--json`
is also served as `GET /api/usage`. Claude-first (other agents' logs don't carry
usage yet); the hook evaluates on every lifecycle event — near-real-time during
tool-driven work; a long silent generation settles at its next event (P2: serve
tick).

> **Network-aware launch:** gtmux prefixes agent launches (`gtmux hq` / `adopt` /
> restore / the limits command) with a proxy when needed, so you never hand-toggle
> one across networks. `~/.config/gtmux/config.json` → `"agentProxy": "auto"`
> (default) applies `http://127.0.0.1:<agentProxyPort, 7897>` **iff that port is
> listening** (your proxy tool is running — the home-VPN case) and nothing
> otherwise (intranet); an explicit URL forces it, `"off"` disables.

## `gtmux events` — the session event stream (subscription)

```
22:50:40  working          api:0.0        Claude Code (%7)
22:51:02  waiting·permission  api:0.0     Claude Code (%7)
22:53:19  idle             web:1.0        Codex (%11)
```

The hook appends every session's lifecycle event (start / finish / waiting /
background) to a ROTATED log (`~/.local/share/gtmux/events.jsonl`, active 20 MB +
1 rotated ≈ 40 MB ceiling, `eventsCapMB` config; `0` disables). `gtmux events`
prints the last hour; `--since 10m|2h` a window; `--follow` streams live and is
rotation-aware (never silently stops). This is the terminal-native SUBSCRIPTION
to the same events the apps get over SSE — gtmux HQ tails it to stay aware of any
session's execution without re-polling.

## `gtmux resource` — local machine resource watch

```
disk 40GB free · mem 38% free (warn) · load 0.64×14 cores   ⚠ disk 40GB free
per-agent (RSS · CPU):
  %26    252MB · 9.2%
reclaim candidates (orphans no live agent owns):
  pid 3015  100MB · 0.0%  iOS Simulator runtime (12 procs) [simulator]
    ↳ leftover iOS Simulator runtime — `xcrun simctl shutdown all`
```

Disk (`df`), memory (`memory_pressure -Q` free % + the kernel `kern.memorystatus_vm_pressure_level`
normal/warn/critical tier), CPU (loadavg÷cores). **Per-agent RSS/CPU** by walking
each pane's process tree (isomorphic to token accounting), and **reclaim
candidates** — heavy processes no live pane owns, named with pid + how to reclaim
(a leftover iOS Simulator runtime aggregates into one entry; dev servers/tmux
strays surface individually). Thresholds in `~/.config/gtmux/config.json`'s
`resource` object (diskAmberGB 50 / diskRedGB 15 / loadAmber 1.0 / loadRed 1.5 /
orphanRssMB 300). A resource block rides `GET /api/usage`; the serve tick emits a
`resource·warn` nudge to HQ (single-writer — one per crossing); `gtmux hq`/`new`
warn at a red line before adding load.

## `gtmux limits` — real subscription-window remaining

```
● session               16% used   resets Jul 13 at 1:29am
● week (all models)     60% used   resets Jul 17 at 10:59pm
● week (fable)          90% used   resets Jul 17 at 10:59pm
⚠ near the weekly cap: week (fable) 90%
```

The one number local estimation can't give you: **how much of your plan is
left**. gtmux gets it from the agent's OWN `/usage` command run headlessly
(`claude -p "/usage"`) — real server data, the user's sanctioned command, not a
reverse-engineered endpoint. Because that spawns a process, results are **cached**
(`state/limits.json`) with a 15-minute TTL, shortened to 5 minutes once any
window is near its cap; `--refresh` forces one. Configure in
`~/.config/gtmux/usage.json`:

```json
{"limitsCommand": "claude -p /usage", "limitsTTLMin": 15,
 "limitsTTLNearMin": 5, "limitsNearPct": 70, "limitsWarnPct": 85}
```

Set `limitsCommand` with an env prefix if your network needs it
(`"HTTPS_PROXY=… claude -p /usage"`), or `""` to disable. A weekly window at/over
`limitsWarnPct` marks amber and nudges a live HQ once (`[gtmux] limits·warn …`).
The `limits` block also rides `gtmux usage` and `GET /api/usage`.

## `gtmux restore`

Quitting your terminal leaves the tmux server and all sessions alive — only the
tabs are gone. After reopening, run **once** in any tab:

```sh
gtmux restore            # one terminal tab per tmux session, all attached
gtmux restore --pick     # choose which sessions: "1 3" / "1,3", Enter = all, q = cancel
gtmux restore --one      # attach the next unattached session in this tab
gtmux restore <name>     # attach a specific session here
gtmux restore --dry-run  # print what would happen, change nothing
```

The first run pops an Automation permission dialog ("wants to control Ghostty") —
click Allow. **After a reboot** the tmux server is gone too; `gtmux restore`
starts tmux and explicitly drives
[tmux-resurrect](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect) to restore the
last autosave (it waits for the restore to finish — large layouts take 30s+ —
and if a saved layout exists but can't be restored it refuses to overwrite it).
Running programs are not restarted — relaunch e.g. with `claude --resume`.

Each pane's previous output (scrollback) comes back too — a snapshot — when
resurrect is set to capture it. Recommended in `tmux.conf`:

```tmux
set -g @resurrect-capture-pane-contents 'on'   # snapshot each pane's scrollback
set -g history-limit 50000                     # how much scrollback to keep/restore
```

> The shell's **↑ command history** is separate — it lives in your shell's
> histfile, not in resurrect. By default it's written only on shell exit, so a
> reboot loses recent commands. To persist it immediately (bash):
> `shopt -s histappend; PROMPT_COMMAND='history -a'` in `~/.bashrc` (zsh:
> `setopt INC_APPEND_HISTORY`).

## `gtmux overview`

```
gtmux overview — 2 sessions · 3 windows · 5 panes

▶ web-api              1 window · 1 pane
    0: web-api *  (1 pane)
● worker               2 windows · 4 panes
    0: editor  (1 pane)
    1: claude *  (3 panes)

▶ current  ● attached  ○ detached   * active  Z zoomed  • new output
```

A sessions/windows/panes summary from any shell. `--popup` is size-fitted for a
tmux `display-popup`, so you can bind it to a key and float it over a full-screen
program without interrupting it.

## `gtmux focus`

```sh
gtmux focus web          # bring the terminal tab showing session "web" to front
gtmux focus %11          # jump to that exact window+pane, then focus its tab
```

Each tab title is `session — window`, so `focus` finds the matching tab and
brings it to front (via the terminal's AppleScript). A pane id (`%N`) also
selects that window+pane inside the session, so you land exactly where the agent
is — which is how a notification click drops you on the agent that just finished.

> Needs `set-titles on` with `set-titles-string '#S — #W'` so tab titles stay in
> the format `focus` matches. If another tool also writes the tab title, disable
> that so titles stay authoritative.

## tmux integration

gtmux is just a CLI — bind whatever keys you like in `tmux.conf`. Suggested:

```tmux
set -g set-titles on
set -g set-titles-string '#S — #W'
bind g run-shell -b "gtmux overview --popup"
bind a display-popup -E -w 80% -h 60% "gtmux agents --watch --popup"
bind J run-shell "gtmux focus --last"
```

## Notification hook

`⏸ waiting`, `✓ latest`, and click-to-jump notifications rely on a hook writing
state files under `~/.local/share/gtmux/`. gtmux ships that hook built in — no
external script needed:

```sh
gtmux install-hooks                 # Claude, one-time setup (macOS)
gtmux install-hooks --agent codex   # or cursor|gemini|copilot|kiro
gtmux uninstall-hooks [--agent …]   # reverse it
```

`install-hooks` registers `gtmux hook` in `~/.claude/settings.json` on the
`Stop`, `Notification`, and `UserPromptSubmit` events (idempotent; preserves
other hooks and backs the file up). `gtmux hook` is the producer — Claude Code
runs it, you don't — and writes state purely by event **timing**, telling a
permission request from an idle nudge without reading message text.

**Other agents:** `--agent codex|cursor|gemini|copilot|kiro` wires that agent's
own hooks file instead. **Codex** uses its additive hooks system
(`~/.codex/hooks.json` + `features.hooks`), so it **coexists with any existing
`notify`** (e.g. computer-use) rather than replacing it. `gtmux doctor --fix`
offers to wire whatever agents it detects.

Notifications are delivered by the menu-bar app — no `terminal-notifier` needed.
The hook queues a request under `~/.local/share/gtmux/notify/` and `Gtmux.app`
posts a native banner (shown as **Gtmux**, with the agent icon and a **Jump**
action; *finished* is calm and silent, *needs your input* sounds). Clicking it
lands you on the exact pane. Grant "Allow Notifications" on first run and keep
the app running to receive them.

## Permissions

gtmux asks for only what it needs:

- **Automation (control Ghostty)** — required for `focus` / `restore` / `new` and
  notification click-to-jump. macOS prompts the first time gtmux drives the
  terminal via AppleScript; click **Allow**.
- **Notifications** — so the menu-bar app can post agent banners. Allow on first run.
- **Launch at login** *(optional)* — only if you enable it in Preferences.

It does **not** need these — if macOS prompts, you can safely **Deny** with no
loss of function:

- **App Management ("modify apps on your Mac")** — gtmux never modifies other
  apps; its code only ever touches its own bundle (on update/uninstall). The
  prompt can appear when macOS attributes *another* app's self-update to gtmux's
  long-running background process via its responsible-process chain. Denying
  changes nothing for gtmux.
- **Files & Folders (Downloads / Desktop / Documents)** — gtmux doesn't read
  these. The prompt can appear when `restore` recreates a tmux session whose
  working directory lives in one of them — that's `tmux` (run by gtmux) opening
  the folder. Safe to deny.
