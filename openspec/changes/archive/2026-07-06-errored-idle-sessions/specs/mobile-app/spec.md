## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Mark errored idle rows in the mobile radar

The mobile radar SHALL visually distinguish an idle agent that ended on an error
(`error: true` in the `agents --json` contract) from a successfully-finished idle
agent, using an amber ⚠ "errored" modifier and the `error_text` summary in place of
the green ✓. The row SHALL remain in the idle section and MUST NOT use the red
`waiting`/needs-you color.

#### Scenario: Errored idle agent

- **WHEN** an agent row has `status: idle` and `error: true`
- **THEN** the mobile radar renders it in the idle section with an amber ⚠ marker
  (not the green ✓) and surfaces the `error_text` summary
- **AND** it is not colored red and does not sort into the needs-you section

#### Scenario: Successful idle agent unchanged

- **WHEN** an agent row has `status: idle` without `error`
- **THEN** the mobile radar renders it exactly as today (green ✓)
