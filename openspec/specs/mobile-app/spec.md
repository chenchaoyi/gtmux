# Mobile App Specification

## Purpose

A phone app (the third surface) to monitor your tmux coding agents remotely, get
lock-screen push when one needs you, and — gated only by the pairing bearer token —
type back into a pane to unstick or steer an agent. Its look mirrors the menu-bar
app, so all three surfaces read as one product.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Pair with a Mac

The system SHALL let the user pair a Mac by host+token (and, later, a scanned
pairing QR), validating reachability + token before saving the pair to the device
Keychain.

#### Scenario: Manual pairing

- **WHEN** the user enters the Mac's reachable host and token and connects
- **THEN** the app verifies `/api/health` + an authed call, saves the pair to the
  Keychain, and shows the Radar; a failure gives a plain reachability diagnosis

### Requirement: Mirror the status language

The system SHALL render agents with the status language identical to the menu-bar
app — authoritative status colors, the same shapes+glyphs (waiting red square+
pause, working cyan static ring, idle green check, running gray dot), and the
fixed section order waiting→working→idle→running.

#### Scenario: Radar matches the menu bar

- **WHEN** the Radar shows agents
- **THEN** their colors, shapes, glyphs, sectioning, and `primary`/`secondary`
  row text match the menu-bar app

### Requirement: Live radar via SSE

The system SHALL load agents from `/api/agents` and refetch on the `agents` SSE
event, show an in-app banner on a foreground `alert`, and reflect connection
state. `/api/agents` is the only data source.

#### Scenario: Live update

- **WHEN** an agent's status changes on the Mac
- **THEN** the Radar updates via the SSE-triggered refetch

### Requirement: Detail with terminal + chat views

The system SHALL show a selected agent's Detail in two switchable views kept fresh:
a "终端/terminal" view rendering the pane's live screen via the native pane renderer
(see `mobile-pane-renderer`), and a "对话/chat" view rendering the parsed transcript
(see `mobile-chat-view`, fed by `/api/transcript`). (A phone-side "focus on Mac"
action was removed in #85 — it has little value when you are remote; the `/api/focus`
endpoint stays for the browser mirror + as a stable contract.)

#### Scenario: Terminal view

- **WHEN** the user opens an agent's Detail terminal view
- **THEN** the pane's live screen is rendered (colors, cursor, long-press copy) and
  kept fresh

#### Scenario: Chat view

- **WHEN** the user switches Detail to the chat view
- **THEN** the parsed transcript is shown as a conversation and kept fresh

### Requirement: Push registration + tap deep-link

The system SHALL, when paired and push is enabled, request notification
permission, register the APNs device token to the Mac, and deep-link a tapped
notification to that agent's Detail (including cold start).

#### Scenario: Tap a push

- **WHEN** the user taps a delivered push carrying a `pane`
- **THEN** the app opens to that agent's Detail

### Requirement: Terminal input, gated by the pairing token

The system SHALL let the user type into a pane — literal text (optionally + Enter),
named control keys, and the waiting-pane `1/2/3` approval choices — via
`POST /api/send`, gated ONLY by the pairing bearer token (no separate
authorization), so the token must be treated as a password. After a send, the app
SHALL refresh the pane promptly (not wait for the next poll) so the user sees the
effect of their input quickly; it MAY optimistically echo a sent prompt.

#### Scenario: Send text

- **WHEN** the user types a message in the composer and sends it
- **THEN** the text is delivered via `/api/send` and the pane refreshes promptly to
  show the result

#### Scenario: Answer an approval

- **WHEN** a pane is waiting on a numbered prompt and the user taps a choice
- **THEN** the bare digit is sent via `/api/send` **without a trailing Enter** (the
  agent's numbered menus commit on the digit alone; a trailing Enter would leak onto
  the next prompt and auto-confirm it on consecutive selections) and the pane
  refreshes promptly
- **AND** the choices are presented as a compact row of number chips (`1..N`), not
  re-sketched label rows — the labels are already visible in the terminal/chat

### Requirement: Mobile shows native sessions in an "Elsewhere" section
The mobile app SHALL group `source: "native"` sessions into their own "Elsewhere / 不在 tmux" section, separate from the tmux status groups. These rows are sense-only: they carry a `native` tag, no jump chevron, and tapping one SHALL NOT open a terminal mirror (there is none). Moving a native session into tmux stays a menu-bar/CLI action; the mobile app is display-only for the native category.

#### Scenario: Native section on mobile
- **WHEN** the phone polls the radar and native sessions are present
- **THEN** they SHALL appear in a dedicated "Elsewhere" section, marked non-tappable (no terminal), distinct from the tmux groups

#### Scenario: Tapping a native row does nothing
- **WHEN** the user taps a native row on mobile
- **THEN** the app SHALL NOT navigate to a terminal/detail view for it

### Requirement: Mark errored idle rows in the mobile radar

The mobile radar SHALL visually distinguish an idle agent that ended on an error
(`error: true` in the `agents --json` contract) from a successfully-finished idle
agent, using an amber ⚠ "errored" modifier and the `error_text` summary in place of
the green ✓. The row SHALL remain in the idle section and MUST NOT use the red
`waiting`/needs-you color.

#### Scenario: Errored idle agent

- **WHEN** an agent row has `status: idle` and `error: true`
- **THEN** the mobile radar renders it in the idle section with an amber ⚠ marker
  (not the green ✓) and surfaces the `error_text` summary
- **AND** it is not colored red and does not sort into the needs-you section

#### Scenario: Successful idle agent unchanged

- **WHEN** an agent row has `status: idle` without `error`
- **THEN** the mobile radar renders it exactly as today (green ✓)
